## Abstract
- 최근 DNN은 다양한 분야에서 큰 성공을 거뒀지만, 추천 시스템 분야에서의 DNN 시도는 상대적으로 적음
- 기존의 MF의 inner product를 neural architecture로 대체하는 NCF 프레임워크를 제시함
- item 2

## Images

By default, the image is centered and the image caption can be displayed at the bottom:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png)
_Full screen width and center alignment_

You can change the size of the picture:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="400"}
_400px image width_

In addition, you can use class `normal` , `left` and `right` to specify the image position (but in these case, the image caption is prohibited), for example:

- Normal position

  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="350" class="normal"}

- Float to the left

  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="240" class="left"}

## Inline code

This is an example of `Inline Code`.

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
